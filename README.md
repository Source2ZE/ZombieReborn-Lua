# ZombieReborn-Lua

This was an experimental implementation of Zombie Escape in Counter-Strike 2 using the now disabled Lua [VScript API](https://cs2.poggu.me/dumped-data/vscript-list). It is no longer supported, see the [main repository](https://github.com/Source2ZE/ZombieReborn) for instructions on installing the currently supported ZR implementation.

Development of Lua ZR started immediately following CS2's limited test release in March 2023, making ZE the first custom gamemode in CS2. Lua ZR allowed for early testing of ZE during the limited test, allowing us to identify issues and playtest maps. It even spent a short period on several public servers following the workshop release, until better solutions arose.
